## What is the Factory Design Pattern?

**Core Concept:**

* Factory Pattern is a way to create objects without exposing the creation logic to
 the client. Instead of using new everywhere, you delegate object creation to a 
 factory (a separate function or class).

### Why use it?

- To avoid writing `new` everywhere and hardcoding object types.
- To **centralize object creation logic**.
- To **easily switch or extend object types** in future without modifying client code.
